# NoPorno!
A porn blocker just to help somes who have addiction. It'll be something new so check it!


## Useage

1. Install the extension by simply downloading the repository and installing the extension from file in the browser's extension panel. (Don't know how to do it? <a href="https://ourtechroom.com/tech/manually-locally-install-chrome-extension/">Here is a nice guide to check!</a>)
2. Just browser as you sould normally do it.
3. If your attention would go a an xxx site the extension will activated and block the site!
4. Now comes the nice part: this not just blocking the porn site, it redirects you to a new site where you will distraced from porn. (eg. music/cute, amazing pictures, videos, pages, articles)


## How it works?

Simply blocks the site and redirect to a new one as it says.
But the method behind this is the tricky part of it: not just blocking the website as a normal porn blocker would, it makes things better via redirecting. In many times ones would even watch porn after a blocker has been activated as the sexual energies are not really gone so the best way is to distract one's attention from porn. Here comes this project!
**You can submit your own sites/links which can be in the good site's list to help eachother!**


## Idea

One day I just saw <a href="https://github.com/mrvivacious/PorNo-_Porn_Blocker">mrvivacious's PorNo - Porn Blocker</a> repository and I just thought - this is not that hard I could do it. I figred out that it is not easy but I managed it somehow so I guess I'm proud of myself.
Especially I don't have any porn addiction or anything; maybe I had but I fought it but this is not the matter why I started this project. The matter is maybe that I wanted to have a little bigger project even if it's just a browser extension but it makes our world somehow happier and I hope maybe fewer porn addicted people will live on the Earth.
Okay this was the nice and fairytale part - I just wanted an useful project with I can make myself coller in my class; and maybe to make a little sociology research with how many block can it count.
